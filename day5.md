# Day 5

## What is Lola's date of birth? Format: Month Date, Year(e.g November 12, 2019)
Supporting material suggests we need to try and work out as much information on Lola, using the following techniques:
- exiftool
- Reverse image search
- Wayback archive

Exiftool was the first port. I have an image to scan it's metadata. I install exiftool and run it on the image provided.

This gives me a lot of information, but I miss the Creator.

Without reading through the information given, I missed that the creator gives me what looks like a username. This is the key hint.

I can then google search the username and I am presented with a twitter account.

## What is Lola's current occupation?
This was presented in the information on the twitter bio.

## What phone does Lola make?
Her tweets suggest the elfs make Iphone X's.

## What date did Lola first start her photography? Format: dd/mm/yyyy
On her twitter bio is a website. I visit the website. Nothing there to state when Lola started.

I put the website through the wayback archive and I am then shown the first ever page. It states she has been a photographer for 5 years today. This gives me the ability to work out when she started.

## What famous woman does Lola have on her web page?
Using an image on her website, I push this through the reverse image search to find out the famous woman.
